# GPT4 OpenAI unofficial API

## 

Have you applied to GPT-4 API access but OpenAI is too busy to reply? Me too, that's why I created this library. It uses [selenium webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) to emulate user interaction on [chat.openai.com](chat.openai.com). If the account has `ChatGPT Plus`, the driver will use GPT-4, otherwise it will use the default GPT-3.5.

**Note:** This unofficial API library is not endorsed by OpenAI and violates their Terms of Service. Use it at your own risk; the creator assumes no liability for any consequences. Please adhere to platform's ToS and exercise caution with unofficial resources.

The core logic was taken from Github repo called [IntelligenzaArtificiale/Free-Auto-GPT](https://github.com/IntelligenzaArtificiale/Free-Auto-GPT).
